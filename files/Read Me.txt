We have been provided with information on 10,000 students, covering both personal and skills-related details. This information is divided across two separate files. Your tasks are as follows:

1. Create a TOF file to store the fields from the first file (include a loading factor).
2. Create a TOVS file by expanding the TOF file with additional data from the second CSV file.
3. Calculate and display
The number of read and write operations performed after each insertion and deletion to save in a separate file.
Header information of each binary file.
Statistics about data and the file: average loading factor before and after deletion, number of missing values, TOF fragmentation (unused space inside records). Add your suggestions to comprehend the file content in both organizations.
Statistics about the operations (insertion, deletion) : success and failure.
Dataset Description:
1. students_data_1a.csv:
Contains basic identity details for each student, including a unique ID, names, and birthplace. The records are unordered, and some entries include duplicates or missing values to reflect real-world data challenges.

2. students_data_2a.csv:
Provides academic details linked to the same student IDs as in students_data_1a.csv. This file includes each studentâ€™s
current year of study and a list of acquired skills. As with the first file,
some entries are incomplete to simulate potential data gaps.
3. delete_students.csv : contains IDs to delete.

Note: The application should read sequentially the provided files without any external modification.

Nice Coding!
